# rfitsio
pure Rust implementation of the better known cfitsio

## Why this and not cFITSio?
Simple reasons:
1) Great way to improve Rust abilities and the Rust ecosystem
2) Safety of the code!

## Who should use this?
At the moment only people who want to develop it or want to mess around, this is used partially by ASI drivers for testing purposes tho,
so it does its (small) work decently already
